    <h1>Great Non-Material Wealth</h1>
    <p>
      Some lucky people today enjoy extreme non-material wealth,
      well beyond what is available within mainstream culture.  We'll give
      some examples of what is available.  We can use these
      statements as clues to create our own vision of non-material
      wealth where these don't do it for us.  We might also pay
      particular attention to where our mind rebels from imagining
      ourselves having some of these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the things mentioned here and much more are available to
      any person regardless of their social position, history or other
      individual characteristics.  They are generally not available
      without training and support.  Finding the training and support
      which would allow us to have great non-material wealth is the
      great challenge.  The rest of the website contains more clues
      that may be helpful.

    <p>
    <h2>Examples </h2>
    <h3> Freedom from Shame and Fear</h3>
    <p>
      We are completely comfortable with our body, clothed or
      unclothed.  We accept its design, we have awe and wonder at
      its myriad sensitivities and functions.  We experience great
      pleasure from it.  We share it with our intimate friends.  We
      are similarly comfortable with and appreciative of others'
      bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are completely comfortable with being a sexual being.  We
      are comfortable with any and all of our sexual preferences
      without being limited by them.  Our sexuality gives us
      unlimited ecstasy with ourselves and with others.  Our sexuality
      is one of our accesses to a vast natural spirituality.
    </p>
    <p>
      We accept and appreciate all of our emotions.  We can express
      our emotions to others in ways that allow those others to fully
      understand and empathize.  We accept and appreciate all other
      aspects of our mind, "rational" or "irrational."  With no shame
      or embarrassment over any of our limitations or "irrational"
      tendencies, we are able to grow emotionally and intellectually
      without limit.
    </p>
    <h3> Friends, Lovers and Partners</h3>
    <p>
      We have over a hundred friends whom we love and know deeply and
      intimately.  They love and know us similarly.  They and we
      share great joy.  We empower one another's growth and
      development.  We experience our friends as wealth beyond the
      imaginings of people who merely pursue the wealth of money and status.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our sexuality is untainted by any feelings of jealousy. We
      have unlimited extraordinary sexual connection with many dear
      friends.  We share ecstasy with others as a divine gift and
      love to know that our dearest partners are able to experience
      such ecstasy whether or not we are with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have deep partnerships with many of our friends, going
      deeper than is typical in most good marriages or lifelong
      friendships.  Total honesty and transparency allow us to
      operate together in love as we raise extraordinary children,
      create great works of art and fulfil many other life goals.
    </p>
    <h3> Our Intellectual Life</h3>
    <p>
      Our understanding of all aspects of life is immense.  We are
      always learning and love to learn.  Our ability to learn is
      always increasing.  A great many things interest us -- in fact,
      we are developing new interests ongoingly.  Nothing that
      interests us is beyond our ability to learn or to meaningfully
      participate with.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we learn more and more, we become aware of new areas of the
      Universe.  What we don't know increases faster than what we
      know and our appreciation of the wonder and mystery of the
      Universe and of Being are always expanding.
    </p>
    <h3> Accomplishment, Productivity and Community </h3>
    <p>
      We have accomplished great projects of which we are immensely
      proud and which are well appreciated by others.  Our productivity in
      accomplishing great results is very great and increases over
      time as part of our ongoing growth and development.  What we
      accomplish, individually and in parthership enriches our
      community.  The other members of our community are similarly
      productive and we are in continual awe and wonder at the
      accomplishments of our community and of how they enrich our life.
    </p>
    <h3> Transformation and Being Present </h3>
    <p>
      We experience ourselves as the inventor of all of the meaning in our
      life.  Our life is an ongoing work of art and we are its
      master creator.  We perceive fear as a mechanism which brings
      us to full attention and it is then transformed into the next
      appropriate emotion.  Life is free from suffering.  We never do
      anything out of a pursuit of status or attempt to belong - we
      already have a permanent high status and we inherently belong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our ability to be present to ourselves, with others and with the
      world increases with our growth.  Our great knowledge and
      sophistication is loosely held and can easily be put into the
      background.  Clarity, intuition, curiosity and wonder give us joy,
      lightness of being and power.
