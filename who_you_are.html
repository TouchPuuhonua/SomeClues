    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>
      There are so many ways to respond to this interesting question,
      thanks for asking it!
    </p>
    <p>
      You could be your body, or some collection of material
      structures in your body.  In this case you're mostly less than
      six months old, as your metabolic processes are continually
      replacing your tissues with new molecules built from the food
      you've taken in.  The old you has broken down and been excreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could be your mind.  Your personality.  Your opinions.  Your
      thoughts and feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could be your commitments - your word.  You could literally
      speak who you are as your free creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could be a portal between the (source / ground of being /
      God / Buddha nature) and the material world.  Would you then be
      the same being or a different being from others?
    </p>
    <p>
      You could be what you contribute.  Your work, your nurturing of
      the important people in your life.  The love you give.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could be a mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could be.
    </p>
