    <h1>What do we mean by Clues?</h1>
    <p>
      Contributors to SomeClues.org, hereafter known as
      ClueDispensors, are curious people who have been searching
      vigorously for <i>"What it's all about"</i> for many years.  Our
      inquiry has revealed that much of the conventional worldview is
      either false or misleading, and that many preposterous
      possibilities are in fact available and life transforming.  We
      have created this website to allow us to share clues with one
      another.  You are welcome to join us!
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not interested in having other people's beliefs and
      answers foisted upon us; therefore, we do not wish to foist our
      viewpoints on others.  It is our experience that beliefs about
      how life is, and answers to life's challenges can close down a
      person's options and rob them of power.  As ClueDispensors we
      wish to simply share clues, sometimes accompanied with links to
      resources which may be useful in following up on that clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clue is a hint or a pointer to the existence of something or
      some area which we might otherwise overlook.  Without a clue we
      might miss something valuable or even essential to having a life
      of great possiblity.  A clue won't tell us what that great life
      will look like.  It won't tell us what to think, what to believe
      or what to do.  A clue won't give us that great life, but it may
      be useful in our discovering a path to that great life which is
      uniquely ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because clues are merely pointers, they are neither true nor
      false (apologies here to C programmers).  English is not
      particularly generous in providing grammatical forms for
      expressing clues, so parts of this site may look like claims and
      assertions rather than clues.  Big Meta Clue: Everything on this
      site is intended to be taken as a clue, not as our opinion.
      Please don't make the mistake of believing anything you read on
      this site.  Follow the clue and check it out for yourself!
