    <h1>Participating in this Website</h1>
    This website has just moved to <a
    href="https://github.com/TouchPuuhonua/SomeClues">this Github
        Repository</a>. To participate in this project at this time you'll need a
    <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account from which you can
    <ul>
        <li>post issues</li>
        <li>contact other Clue Dispensors</li>
        <li>clone this repository</li>
        <li>improve your clone of the repository</li>
        <li>send pull requests to the official repository</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Yes, <em>git</em> and <em>github</em> are pretty geeky and complicated,
        creating a barrier blocking some people from participating in this and other
        projects. Some of our friends are working on something easier called
        <a href=" https://gregdavidson.github.io/wicci-core-S0_lib/">The Wicci System</a>
        but it isn't done yet. In fact, it needs some more geeky folks to
        help! If you know of some, or perhaps you are one, please contact
        <a> href="https://github.com/GregDavidson">the Wicci Project Coordinator</a>.
