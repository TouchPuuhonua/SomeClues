    <p>
      If I don't go to the Doctor, I'm not really sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Company X: I'll offer you this deal: I'll try to break into
      your computer system; If I fail, I'll let you know you've got
      pretty good security and you owe me nothing; if I succeed, I'll
      give you a report of how you're vulnerable and help you tighten
      your security - all according to my published fee schedule:
      Shall we proceed?  -- Most companies won't go for this, even if
      the offerer is a prestigious security firm; the delusion is the
      "If I don't go to the Doctor, I'm not really sick." fallacy.
    </p>
