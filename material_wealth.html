    <h1>Material Wealth</h1>
    <h2> Beauty, Pleasure and Comfort </h2>
    <p>
      We live in a variety of places, some of which we experience
      deeply as home.  All of these places move us with their
      beauty.  These environments refresh and stimulate our spirit in
      a variety of ways.  Most of these places are works of art in
      progress, becoming more wonderful over time, often in surprising
      ways.  More such places become available to us as time goes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every aspect of our life is filled with comfort and delight.
      All of the food we eat is delicious, beautiful, healthful and
      infinitely varied.  Master chefs prepare it inspired by all of
      the world's great cuisines.  When we wear clothes they are
      sensually delightful to touch, they drape and flow with our
      body and our body's movement and they are beautiful to the eye,
      harmonizing with the structure and colors of our body.  Bathing
      and hygeine are sybaritic experiences which the wealthy Romans
      with their luxurious bathhouses would envy.  We regularly
      receive expert therapeutic, sensual and erotic massage.  We
      participate in delightful vigorous forms of physical exercise.
      <h2> Travel, Work and Leisure </h2>
    <p>
      We have the opportunity to live in many of the most interesting
      places on the planet.  We get to live for a time in many of
      humanity's most interesting cultures - enough time to speak the
      language fluently and think  from that culture's viewpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have ample opportunity to practice the most engaging leisure
      activities which have ever been developed to the exact extent
      we wish to practice them.  We work only and exactly as much as
      we wish, and we love our work.
    </p>
    <h2> Health </h2>
    <p>
      Along with nutritious food and good exercise our overall
      lifestyle gives us the best chances for excellent heath.  In
      the event of serious health problems, we have first-class
      healthcare.  In the event of annoying but non-threatening health
      problems, from colds to dandruff, we have loving care from
      loving friends and  alternative treatments which almost make it
      a pleasure to be sick.
    </p>
    <h2> Freedom from Death </h2>
    <p>
      We are not afraid of death and are well aware that part of us
      is dying in each moment and that that very process is what
      generates the quality of a good life, but here when we say death
      we mean the real thing - the end of the functioning of our
      physical body, permanently extinguishing our spirit.  This is
      commonly thought to be inevitable - it is not.
    <p>
      While at this time death cannot always be avoided, there is a
      very good chance that we can indeed either avoid it, or that it
      can be reversed should it occur.  We are likely therefore to be
      alive for the rest of human history and be offered the chance to
      become or merge with the entities we expect human beings will
      create to replace themselves.
