    <h1>Aberrant Epistemology, or <em>Cult Science</em></h1>
    <p>
    Scholars in all fields do research, publish books and papers,
    attend conferences and criticise (often very aggressively) the
    validity of their colleagues' work.
  </p>
  <p>
  What is not obvious is the nature of the methodologies and
  other structures of integrity which allow some fields to genuinely and
  ongoing extend human knowledge while other fields are merely going
  through the motions.
  </p>
  <p>
  A number of fields of study are cults: closed systems of thought
  actively hostile to real research data, merely recirculating
  superstitions and playing social and intellectual dominance games.
  </p>
  <p>
  Some of these abberrant scholastic
  fields address fundamental concerns to human beings.  These seem to include
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>The study of education</li>
  <li>Penology</li>
  <li>Psychotherapy</li>
  <li>Most sociology and anthropology</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Most other fields contain pockets of cult science which
  significantly impede the progress of the field as a whole.
  </p>
  <p>
  The tendency of society as a whole to trust the findings of
  researchers without checking the integrity of their research
  programs contributes significantly to the failure of much
  of our social, economic and political systems.
  </p>
  <p>
  Society generously funds credentialed researchers operating within
  closed systems of thought and collaborates with these
  pseudo-scholars by ignoring or punishing researchers who
  attempt to perform valid research in their field.
