    <h1>What To Believe?</h1>
    <p>
      We have some really interesting options in what to believe in
      in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we would like the approval of a traditional community, we
      can simply adopt their beliefs.  Most people do.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we are concerned with believing what is True, rather than
      what is False, we could look to Religion.  Many religions
      concern themselves with issues of what is True and what is
      False.  Let's call these the True Religions, e.g., most versions
      of Christianity and Islam.  The True Religions assert that
      holding the right beliefs is terribly important!  And they
      tell us what those right beliefs are.  Isn't it interesting
      that different True Religions disagree on these terribly
      important matters?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some religions are designed to free us from our need to
      have rigid beliefs.  Let's call these the Maybe Religions.
      The classic examples of Maybe Religions are Zen Buddism and
      Taoism.  Are Buddism and Taoism religions?   Maybe!  Some
      versions of Christianity and Islam are also Maybe Religions -
      we'll have to look a bit to find them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people in the modern world look to Science to find out what
      to believe.  School science teachers and popular experts on
      Science will tell us what to believe.  This is quite odd, as
      science does not deal in beliefs!  The Scientific method is
      concerned with constructing and testing models of reality, and
      makes no claim about the actual nature of reality, if there is
      such a thing as reality and if it has an actual nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathematics provides a pretty firm foundation for belief.
      Mathematical methods exist which can often be used to
      prove statements true or false beyond a shadow of a doubt.
      What's the catch?  The statements have to be mathematical claims
      about mathematical objects.  Mathematics does not apply to the
      real world.  Fortunately for Science, Mathematics applies quite
      nicely to Scientific Models.  We have some <a href="mathematics.html">clues about mathematics</a>
