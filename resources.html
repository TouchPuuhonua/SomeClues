    <h2>Practical Training and Experiences</h2>

    <p>
    The word <em>training</em> is used both for imparting the lowest
    level mindless skills through rote drill and conditioning, and for
    the highest, most creative intensive educational experiences.
    Training in the latter sense refers to all of the aspects of
    education that go beyond the transfer of information and
    intellectual understanding.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Artists, musicians and scientists talk about <em>where they got
    their training</em> and revere those institutions which reliably
    impart the discernment and discipline required to do excellent
    work while nurturing creativity and growing the student's
    intuition.
    </p>

    <p>
    Many organizations offer training programs for individuals which
    claim to train or coach or enlighten those individuals in a way
    which will give them an extrardinarily great life.  Most of those
    organizations have a belief system which members must ascribe to.
    Many have questionable grounding in reality.  Some are cults.  A
    few offer empowering training going well beyond what is commonly
    believed possible with a minimum of dogma.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is particularly useful to get training from two or more of
    these organizations, as the effect is synergistic and helps
    compensate for the tendency of most powerful organizations to
    create an inbred culture.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.LandmarkEducation.com">Landmark Education
    Corporation</a></h3>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.LandmarkEducation.com"> Landmark Education
      Corporation </a> is the heir to the once-controversial
      transformational organization called <em>est</em> (the latin
      verb <em>to be</em>).  When the inventor of <em>est</em>, Werner
      Erhard, realized that a more straightforward approach to
      transformation might be available he retired the <em>est
      training</em> and created the ancestor of today's <em>Landmark
      Forum</em> workshop.  He later sold the organization to the
      staff who now own it cooperatively and run it through a creative
      consensus process which they teach as part of their strategic
      design technology.
    </p>
    <p>
    Landmark has designed a core curriculum which is a fast and effective
    training for obtaining access to transformation in one's life.  They
    also has an excellent communication program and a special
    post-graduate curriculum called <em>Wisdom</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
		If Landmark has a biggest flaw, it is that they are not always
    gentle about promoting their programs and encouraging participants
    in their programs to spread the word.  A high degree of enthusiasm
    often comes across as false or manipulative.  We suggest ignoring
    any proselitization and instead sharing with graduates we trust.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.hai.org">The Human Awareness Institute</a></h3>

    <p>
    <a href="http://www.hai.org">The Human Awareness Institute</a>,
    usually abbreviated <em>HAI</em> and pronounced like <em>hi</em>
    offers the <em>Love, Intimacy and Sexuality</em> workshop series.
    These extraordinary and lovely workshops gently teach the skills
    of love and intimacy - not sex - we're talking about the real,
    warm, nurturing, connecting unconditional love and joyous intimacy
    which most people are starving for (which is part of why they
    don't get it).
    </p>

    <p>
    Each workshop is one weekend long at a retreat center and consists
    of experiential exercises where the participant gets to learn
    their own lessons.  HAI has almost no dogma.  Do not confuse these
    workshops with sex workshops.  Yes, there is a wonderful impact on
    one's sexuality and sex life, and that is not the main focus of
    the workshops.  Highly (HAI-ly?) recommended.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.cnvc.org/">Compassionate Communication</a></h3>

    <p>
    <a href="http://www.cnvc.org/">The Center for Nonviolent
    Communication</a>, founded by Marshall Rosenberg, teaches
      communication skills which allow people to honestly express
      their needs and emotions without laying anything on the person
      they are speaking with.  They teach an extraordinary sensitivity
      to the maniulative and coercive use of language and offer an
      antidote.  The Center is very involved with peacework throughout
      the world, yet these are very useful skills for anyone to have and 
      are particularly useful in relationship and partnership.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.bodyelectric.org">Body Electric</a></h3>

    <p>
      O.K., all that stuff above sounds really great,  but what about sex?  I'm
      glad you asked!  There are lots of programs which teach
      how to have mind-blowing sex.  The most common programs are
      based on Tantra, which is the East Indian yogic approach to
      sexuality.  Another approach is Quidoshka, which is based on
      North American Indian, particularly Navaho and Cherokee
      traditions.  These are great and they come along with a certain
      amount of the traditional worldview of those traditions.
      Body Electric is different.
    </p>      
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.bodyelectric.org">Body Electric</a> comes
      out of an eclectic tradition including massage, Chinese Taoist
      practice and Queer sexuality - that's Queer as in homosexual.
      Body Electric is a school of Massage which also teaches Erotic
      Massage and Sacred Spirituality.  It was originally founded by
      Joseph Kramer and was only for men, mostly gay or bisexual men.
      Annie Sprinkle (yes, that Annie Sprinkle) and some other wild
      women generalized the practices to include women's sexuality -
      all kinds of women's sexuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the various directors Body Electric has offered workshops
      for working with male/female sexuality, same-gender sexuality
      and accesses to the erotic which transcend any conventional
      category.  Many people find their unique approach both powerful
      and refreshingly modern.  The variety of programs has expanded
      and contracted over the years so check the current catalog.

    <h3><a href="http://www.burningman.com">Burning Man</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.burningman.com">Burning Man</a> is hard to
      describe - no, it's impossible to describe, but let's say a few
      things; after all, this website is all about clues, we don't
      have to trap wild things and put them in boxes.  Burning Man is
      an experiment in radical expression - at the individual, group
      and community levels.  It is a place to have our conventional
      ideas blown open.  It is a place to fire our creativity.  It is
      the best party on the planet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Burning Man is a festival (what might that word mean?) which
      takes place each year at the end of August in a dry lake bed in
      the middle of a desert in Nevada.  Approximately 50,000 people
      come and build a city together which exists for only one week
      and is then completely erased from the desert, but participant's
      lives are permanently marked by the experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check out <a href="http://www.burningman.com"> the website</a>.
      Attend their events in your local region and meet local Burners.
      The event sells out so apply for tickets early.  Print out a
      copy of the themecamp list and highlight all the themecamps
      which sound interesting.  Contact the ones you might want to
      join (web, email and mailing lists are usual) and get on their
      email lists.  Plan your participation in advance.  Take your
      themecamp list with you to help you explore Black Rock City.
      Don't bother taking any drugs, they are superfluous there.  Be
      changed!
