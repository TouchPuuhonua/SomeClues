        Since its creation in 2002, the SomeClues project has been waiting for
        an ideal content management system which would welcome the participation
        of a diverse community. Rather than waiting any longer, your Clue
        Dispensors have decided to revive this project as a
        <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> repository.
        If you're interested in helping us improve it,
