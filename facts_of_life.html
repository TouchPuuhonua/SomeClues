      We die a bit in each moment.  When we try to hold onto who we
      are we become more dead.  It is when we voluntarily give up who we

    <p>
      The whole Universe is a free gift.  Our life is a free gift.
      Receiving life and the Universe as a gift, appreciating them as
      a gift, grants the receiver great power.
