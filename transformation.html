    <p>
      Transformation is not a thing, it's a context.
      </p>
    <p>
      From a
      transformational context, everything is perfect, just the way it
      is and people have barriers to experiencing the perfection which
      everything, including themselves, possesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible for any person to shift from a traditional
      right/wrong, good/bad context to a transformational context.
      They can shift to a transformational context in any moment.
      Their transformation can also be lost in any moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a person shifts to a transformational context they
      experience a profoundly different world.  The experience
      themselves and other people very differently.  A element common
      to people's experience of transformation is unconditional love
      for themselves and other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do people need to become transformed?  No, they're fine the way
      they are.  Yes, untransformed people do suffer more and tend to be less effective at getting their needs met.
